# Current Tasks

This file tracks the current architecture, not superseded implementation generations.

## Complete

- [x] PySide6 desktop entry point and responsive main window.
- [x] Multiline Shopee URL validation and duplicate filtering.
- [x] Output-folder selection and persistence.
- [x] Sequential batch queue with correlation, timeout, cancellation, and verification pause/resume.
- [x] Loopback-only Qt WebSocket bridge.
- [x] Chrome Native Messaging Host and required build/install assets.
- [x] Manifest V3 extension worker-tab orchestration.
- [x] One content-script RPC boundary.
- [x] One canonical Shopee extractor: `chrome_extension/extractor_core.js`.
- [x] One canonical extension `product_result` builder: `sendCompleteProductToDesktop()`.
- [x] Manual extension extraction and manual send through the same result builder.
- [x] Restore manual full-carousel enumeration for the five-visible-media Shopee gallery (nine images plus one excluded video).
- [x] Architecture cleanup removing browser automation, direct extension WebSockets, duplicate protocols, and obsolete tests.
- [x] Task 007A: Windows-safe Product Folder Manager, desktop success-flow integration, and `product_folder` storage on the existing product model.

## Frozen extraction regression

- [x] Known nine-image-plus-one-video product produces nine authoritative images in the automatic flow.
- [x] The manual extension send uses the same authoritative nine-image result path.

Task 007A does not modify the extension, Native Host, bridge parser, gallery traversal, video filtering, or authoritative cache.

## Planned product work

- [ ] Task 007B: download image bytes outside the Qt GUI thread into `product_folder`.
- [ ] Write image files atomically with retries and per-item error reporting.
- [ ] Task 012: replace the provisional folder collision suffix with full duplicate-product handling.
- [ ] Package and verify the full desktop application distribution.

Task 007A creates directories only. It does not issue image HTTP requests or write any files inside product directories.
